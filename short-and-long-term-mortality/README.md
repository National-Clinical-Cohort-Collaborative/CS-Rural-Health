## Abstract
Previous studies demonstrated higher short-term mortality among rural compared with urban residents infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, whether this difference persists remains uncertain. This retrospective cohort study analyzed post-COVID-19 mortality over two years post-infection by rurality using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) repository. We analyzed mortality among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 between April 2020 and December 2022, with follow-up until December 2024. Patients were categorized into urban, urban-adjacent rural (UAR), and nonurban-adjacent rural (NAR) groups based on residential ZIP Code. Mortality differences were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and weighted multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for demographic differences, background risk, and social vulnerability. Among 3,082,978 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, we found a significant association between rurality and 2-year mortality post-infection. Cox regression showed higher mortality among rural residents at 1-, 3-, 12-, and 24-months post-infection. Compared to urban dwellers, the adjusted hazard for 2-year mortality for UAR and NAR were 1.24 (95% CI 1.23-1.25) and 1.31 (1.30-1.32). A reference cohort of 4,153,216 COVID-19-negative patients showed a modest yet consistent rural mortality penalty, which intensified after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight ongoing rural mortality disparities and the need for public health focus on rural communities.
